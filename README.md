# Python 3.4.2

This script computes the cost of the cheapest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in a directed graph using the The Bellman-Ford algorithm.
The input file should have the following format:
number of vertices
start_vertex end_vertex cost
start_vertex end_vertex cost
start_vertex end_vertex cost
...
The script optionally outputs minimal costs, paths to each node, and execution time. If a negative weight cycle is detected, the script terminates.
